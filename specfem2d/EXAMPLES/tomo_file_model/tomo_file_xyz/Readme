# How to run specfem2d from external tomo file in  DATA/tomo_file.xyz and generate the gll binary model for seisNoise


# 1, copy the generate_model.m to generate the tomo_file.xyz in ./DATA

cp ../../../../auxiliaries/tool/generate_model.m   ./

# 2, edit the generate_model.m according to your model and mrun generate_model 

mrun generate_model  # generate the tomo_file.xyz in ./DATA

# 3, reset the Pafile in ./DATA as followed:

MODEL            = default     # 
SAVE_MODEL       = binary      # save as gll binary model
#1 1 1000.d0 2000.d0 900.0d0 0 0 9998.d0 9998.d0 0 0 0 0 0 0  # use the internal model
1 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0                                # use the external model: in DATA/tomo_file.xyz

# 4, run the specfem2d
